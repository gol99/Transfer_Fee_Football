    "For our analysis, we need the reamainig contract length of a player, since it can significantly change the price of a player. The only source that I could find, which has the past contract lengths of a player, is FIFA. Thus, for the 2019/2020 transfer window we want to look at, we can use a FIFA 19  dataframe and get the contract length of the last season before a player left his club. For this, I downloaded a file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19), which has the data for all players on the game, and saved it as \"FIFA19.csv\"."

    "# Get Contract length of player\n",
    "Now we can get the contract lenght of the player. One of the problem we have though, is that the player and club names on FIFA and Transfermarkt.ch are not the same. This makes getting the contract length more complicated, since it is not possible to exactly match the player and club names. As a work around, we can use the `SequenceMatcher` moodule form [`difflib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html). This module makes it possible to calculate a \"Similarity-Ratio\" between two strings. With this ratio we can now compare how similar two strings are. If the Names on Fifa and transfermarkt are similar enough, we can then conclude that this is the same player. While this solution will lead us to missing some players and adding some wrong players, it will also allow us to find the contracts of more players. I tried to minimise the amount of errors by comparing the name, the club and the age of the player. Only if all three are similar, I concluded that the players are the same. While there still were some mistakes (the algorithm for instance concluded that  [Javi Hernández](https://www.fifaindex.com/de/player/244523/javi-hern%C3%A1ndez/changelog/) and [Theo Hernández](https://www.fifaindex.com/de/player/232656/theo-hern%C3%A1ndez/) were the same player, since both have a similar name, left the same club (Real Madrid) and are roughly the same age), I could minimise the amount of mistakes this way."
