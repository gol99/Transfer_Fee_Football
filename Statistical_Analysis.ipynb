    "In this final notebook I will analyse the data I scraped from various sources to find out what factors influence the transfer fee for a player. For this, I will firstly download the data from the repository and make some final data transformations. After that I will make several linear regressions to analyse different relationships with the transferfee. Finally, I will conclude this analysis."

    "Overall, this model seems to have no explanatory power, since the adjusted $R^2$ is negative. None of the Varaiables seem to be significant (p < 0.05), which means that neither the age nor the surplus of goals per 90 minutes a team scored while the player was on the pitch nor the expected surplus of goals per 90 minutes for a team while the player was on the pitch significantly influence the transfer fee. This indicates that wheter the team was successful when the player was on the pitch has no significant effect on the transfer fee of the player."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "To sum up, I have conducted ten linear regressions with the data I attained through web-scraping. Through this, I was able to find certain significant relationships (and certain relationships that were not significant) between player statistics and the transfer fee of a player. Three factors that seem to overall significantly impact the transfer fee of a field player, regardless of position, are the points per game the player has won with his team, the age of the player, and the remaining contract length of the player. This indicates that players that play for a successful team, are young or have a long term contract should be more expensive than other players. Furthermore, two different non-relationships were striking to me in the data. Firstly, stats like Goals or Assists per 90 minutes did not significantly influence the transfer fee. This was surprising to me since scoring goals is arguably the most important thing in football. Secondly, the fact whether a team was successful or not with a player on the pitch did not seem to significantly influence the transfer fee for that player.\n",

    "If we look at what drives (or does not drive) the value of a player based on his position, there are also some surprising findings. For defenders, for instance, I was not able to identify any significant relationships between their defending ability and the transfer fee. However, I was able to identify a significant relationship between passes that progress the game and the transfer fee, which to me indicates that a defender that can play a pass and build up the game from the back is more valuable than a defender that can (just) tackle well. Furthermore, for midfielders, I was able to establish a positive relationship between their amount of Goal Creating Actions per 90 minutes and their transfer value, which means that a midfielder that is able to create a lot of Goal Creating Actions is very valuable. For strikers, I was not able to establish any relationship between a certain attribute and their transfer value. However, I was able to identify certain (surprising) non-relationships for strikers. For instance, the number of goals and assists per 90 minutes a striker produces do not significantly influence the transfer value of a player. Similarly, the difference between goals and expected goals per 90 minutes, where a positive value indicates an above-average ability to score goals (or better luck), did not seem to significantly influence the transfer value of a player. Likewise, the goals per shot on target did not significantly influence the transfer fee of a player, which indicates that the goal-scoring ability of a striker does not influence the transfer value of that striker. Furthermore, the amount of Goal and Shot Creating Actions per 90 minutes of a striker do also not significantly influence the value of a striker.\n",

    "What has to be noted in this analysis though, is that for some players there was no data available on [fbref.com]( https://fbref.com/en/). Because of this, for some players and stats, there is only very little data available. For goalkeepers, for instance, I was unable to identify any relationships since I had less than 20 observations available. Because of this, conclusions from this analysis should be treated cautiously.\n"
